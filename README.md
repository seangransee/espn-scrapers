Scrape sports scores from espn.com for my team's statistics final project.

Example pages that can be used with these scrips:
[NBA](http://espn.go.com/nba/team/schedule/_/name/atl/year/2012/atlanta-hawks)
[NHL](http://espn.go.com/nhl/team/schedule/_/name/ana/year/2012/anaheim-ducks)
[NFL](http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/ari/year/2011)

Once you visit any of these pages (for any season and any team), paste and run the code from the relevant Javascript file. The page will be replaced with the raw tab-delimited data that can be pasted into our data collection spreadsheet.
